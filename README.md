# Hands-On Workshop on VEGA Processors and Ecosystem  
**Vellore Institute of Technology, Chennai**  
📅 **February 22, 2025 – April 14, 2025**

---

## 📘 Overview  
This repository contains the source codes, pin connection details, and output snapshots for a series of embedded systems activities completed as part of the **Hands-On Workshop on VEGA Processors and Ecosystem** at VIT Chennai. The activities are designed to provide practical experience with the **Aries Development Board** and the **VEGA processor ecosystem**, covering sensor interfacing, display modules, and real-world embedded applications.

## 📁 Contents of the repository
- **Activity Codes**: Well-documented source codes for each activity including sensor interfacing, display control, buzzer tunes, RFID attendance, and RTC-based alarm systems. A total of 6 activities, and covering 11 codes of practical application.
- **General Component-wise projects**: Separate code and mini-projects run for blink, buzzer, display, IR, RYG and Ultrasonic; some of them similar to the project or practice codes.
- **Practice Codes**: Quick example codes for common modules (UART, GPIO, PWM, SPI, I2C, etc.).
- **Documentation**: An elaborate description with a clear objective, containing the activity codes. In addition to the source codes, the document contains for each code the following:
    - **Pin Details**: Each code has Clear pin mapping for all components and modules used.  
    - **Snapshots**: Output images and circuit diagrams for reference are added to the document.
